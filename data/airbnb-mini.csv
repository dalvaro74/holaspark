You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

She grew up in Tarrytown and spent many lazy afternoons at the lake, swimming at Barton Springs, and running along the hike and bike trails. Our home was built by her grandfather in the 1930s. Back then, it was on the outskirts of town, but now it's right in the middle of everything!

We are empty-nesters as of the Fall of 2016. Our oldest is a UT student, set to graduate in May.  Our youngest is a freshman in college.  Mike and Malia both are educators. Malia has taught Spanish for 27 years and loves to take students abroad each summer. Her favorite cities are Buenos Aires, Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela, Sevilla, Granada, and Mexico DF.  Mike is originally from Ann Arbor, MI. Go Blue! He's a specialist in educational technology, with a particular interest in Physics and math, and  he is an avid hockey player here in Austin.

Our experience as Airbnb guests has been so much fun; we've met so many interesting people and through them have learned so much about the world. When we travel, we prefer home sharing to hiding away in a generic hotel room with little to no contact with others.

Just outside the old city, Dreta de l'Eixample's leafy boulevards are home to Gaudí stunners like Casa Batlló, Casa Mila and La Pedrera (not to mention the distinctive Conservatori Municipal de Música de Barcelona, visible from the bedroom windows). High-end shopping on the ritzy Passeig de Gracia is just a few blocks away, with Plaça de Catalunya and the famous Las Ramblas located less than 20 minutes' walk from our building.;Local permit: HUTB-005631;Whatever it is you came to see in Barcelona, I'll bet it's within easy walking distance of the house.

If you want to venture farther out, it's easy to do on public transport. The nearest metro stations are the L4-Girona stop (yellow line) and the L5-Verdaguer stop (blue line). The L4 will take you to the beach (3 stops), while the L5 will get you to Sants railway station (4 stops) or anywhere else you want to go. And the Mercat de la Concepció bus station is just minutes away, with buses serving Madrid, Seville and basically everywhere else. From the airport, a cab will run you about €45, or take the Aerobus to Plaça Catalunya, which is a short 20-minute walk from the building.;This property features keyless entry, making it easy to get in and out at your convenience.

You could call me a globetrotter - I’ve lived and travelled all over the world, from Australia to Zimbabwe. My adventure with Airbnb started in 2010 when I started sharing my spare rooms with other travellers.

I put down roots in Barcelona, where I strive, with help from my team Karolina and Maria to show guests from across the globe the best of this city. We currently offer 25 luxury apartments, but my approach to hosting is the same: be like a guest's friend in the city, sharing my insider knowledge and keeping them away from tourist traps! 

Once you hit that ""book"" button, your good time is our responsibility. So kick up your feet and grab a drink from the fridge (which we keep stocked). Our apartments aren’t just a place to lay your head...they’re your next home-away-from-home.

I travel a lot - for work and - the best part - also for pleasure. I love meeting new people, tasting new food, experiencing new cultures. I have lived in different countries and continents so traveling is very much part of my DNA as well as my life experience. I have used Airbnb frequently in the past and I am now happy to host fellow travelers.

Although I´m based in Madrid, I spent most of my time traveling for work, so I have decided to share with you my apartment with its great terrace.

But don't worry, you will be well taken care of when I am not in town thanks to my friends at Minty Host, who are there to help my guests anything they need. On my side, I will be more than happy to share with you the Madrid I love - its main landmarks but also its fantastic restaurants, bright squares, and bustling bars. 

Enjoy your stay!

Hola!

Soy una persona curiosa y es lo que me ha llevado a vivir en distintos países, conocer culturas y viajar mucho.

Vivo en Madrid pero estoy todo el tiempo viajando por motivos de trabajo así que he decidido compartir mi apartamento con vosotros y que disfrutéis su maravillosa terraza. Pero no os preocupéis, estaréis muy bien atendidos ya que mis amigos de Minty Host me ayudan a cuidar a mis huéspedes cuando no estoy en la ciudad.

Me encanta viajar y todo tipo de viajes, de ocio y descanso, de turismo, de aventura, a grandes ciudades, pequeños pueblos o lugares salvajes, con familia, amigos o incluso solo. Disfruto mucho conociendo gente y aprendiendo de sus culturas.

He utilizado Airbnb para viajar en numerosas ocasiones y ahora me he decidido a ser anfitrión. Me gusta ofrecer un buen servicio, que la gente quede encantada de la experiencia y que disfruten en la vivienda, del barrio y de la ciudad en la que he vivido gran parte de mi vida y de la que estaré encantado de compartir sus mejores secretos.

Os invito a disfrutar de la estancia!";within an hour;100;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bff15a50-2c8e-459b-8b54-10695d2a67f6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bff15a50-2c8e-459b-8b54-10695d2a67f6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Recoletos;2;2;email,phone,reviews,jumio,government_id;Recoletos, Madrid, Comunidad de Madrid 28001, Spain;Recoletos;Recoletos;Salamanca;Madrid;Comunidad de Madrid;28001;Madrid;Madrid, Spain;ES;Spain;40.42835188930747;-3.687154663105247;Apartment;Entire home/apt;3;1.0;0;2;Real Bed;TV,Internet,Wireless Internet,Air conditioning,Kitchen,Smoking allowed,Elevator in building,Buzzer/wireless intercom,Heating,Family/kid friendly,Washer,Essentials,Shampoo,24-hour check-in,Hangers,Hair dryer,Laptop friendly workspace;;70;;;150;30;2;15;2;1125;today;;7;15;32;292;2017-04-08;36;2016-05-15;2017-04-02;87;9;9;10;10;10;9;;;flexible;1;3.28;40.4283518893,-3.68715466311;Host Has Profile Pic,Host Identity Verified,Is Location Exact,Requires License
